      <h1>Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Joey</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Javascript Engineer from Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. I mostly build React
        apps powered by GraphQL backends.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learn by sharing my knowledge with the community through blog posts,
        workshops, and Open-source. I also hold Graphql meetups so be sure to
        check that out if that's your jam.
      </p>
      <p>
        I take contract/project-based jobs from time to time. If you want to
        discuss a project, you can drop me an email at joeynimu[at]gmail.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my spare time, I spend time with my family, watching Liverpool FC
        play and making road trips to discover new places. You can reach me on
        Twitter @africansinatra.
